## Bonding Curve Dynamics

The Memecita token Launchpad uses bonding curve mechanics to govern token transactions. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Create a Coin**: Ability to create a coin that uses the bonding curve.
2. **Buy the Coin**: The price is set by a bonding curve, which increases as more tokens are bought.
3. **Sell at Any Time**: Tokens can be sold back at the current bonding curve price, allowing for potential profits or losses.
4. **Market Cap of $69k**: The mechanism operates until the coin's market cap reaches $69,000. After which it goes to AMMs.
5. **Liquidity Deposit and Burning**: Upon reaching $69,000, $12,000 in liquidity is deposited into "Raydium" and burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing value.

### Dynamics

- **Price and Supply**: Prices start low to encourage early adoption and rise with demand.
- **Incentives**: Early buyers benefit from lower prices and potential appreciation as more users join.

### Example

1. **Initial Purchase**: Alice buys 10 tokens at $1 each.
2. **Increased Demand**: Bob buys 20 tokens, raising the price to $2.
3. **Selling for Profit**: Alice sells her tokens at $2 each, making a profit.
4. **Market Cap Achievement**: At a $69,000 market cap, $12,000 in liquidity is burned.

### Conclusion

These mechanics create a dynamic market with transparent pricing, encouraging early adoption and stabilizing the ecosystem through liquidity management.
